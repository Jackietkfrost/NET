# NET
## Description
 Non-Public Enactment Transmission or NET for short is a private peer to peer communications program styled like an old school green screen terminal. The point of this project is to learn how to program a P2P system through Electron to have personal conversations with other users akin to an old school IRChat. 
## Installation
run `npm install` to download all the packages needed from Electron, and Peer.js.
## Usage
run `npm start` to start the program.
From there you can access the Client or Host. Work is still being done to be able to run each service individually as different apps.
